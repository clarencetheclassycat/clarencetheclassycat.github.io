Salaam :) My name is Clarence. I travel around the world. 
My mission is to encourage and thank life forms who are defending our world. If I reached out to you, that is because someone asked me to thank you.
If you would like me to thank a life form, please send your life form's email to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>
-- I will bcc you in the email :)
